As the software architect of the Stein Luminary, Steve Cutchin brings to Boise State his leadership experience and guidance in visualization that he gained through working in supercomputer facilities at King Abdullahâ€™s University of Science and Technology, University of California-San Diego, California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, and Walt Disney Feature Animation.

The Keith and Catherine Stein Luminary is an all-digital immersive museum space with touch-activated glass walls, 26K-lumen projectors, and 7.1 digital surround sound, producing a range of immersive, interactive and sensory experiences.

The Stein Luminary combines both touch-activated screens and immersive projection. 

Luminary focuses on visual expierience. Cutchin's work focuses on building and fostering the archiving cultural histories through this project using high technology and intricate software building.
